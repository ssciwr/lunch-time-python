# Lunchtime #6: numba

[numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python.
With a few simple annotations, array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can be
just-in-time optimized to performance similar as C, C++ and Fortran,
without having to switch languages or Python interpreters.
