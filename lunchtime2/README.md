# Lunchtime #2: SymPy (Nov. 26)

[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.
It can parse mathematical expressions, substitute, differentiate, integrate and evaluate them, as well as solve algebraic and differential equations.
It is also itself written entirely in Python, with a focus keeping the code comprehensible and easily extensible.
There is also a related project [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine.py),
which is written in C++ with a focus on speed, which offers a much faster implementation of a subset of SymPy's functionality.
