# Lunchtime 10: PyTorch (October 28th)

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a free and open-source machine learning framework that was originally developed by engineers at Facebook, but is now part of the Linux foundation.
The two main features of PyTorch are its tensor computations framework (similar to numpy) with great support for GPU acceleration and their support for neural networks via autograd.
