Welcome to Lunch Time Python - an event series organized by the [Scientific Software Center](https://ssc.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) at Heidelberg University.

## What it is

Python is a very popular - maybe even *the* most popular - programming language among scientific software developers. One of the reasons for this success story is the rich standard library and the rich ecosystem of available (scientific) libraries. To fully leverage this ecosystem, developers need to stay up to date and explore new libraries. *Lunch Time Python* aims at providing a communication platform between Pythonistas to learn about new libraries in an informal setting. Sessions take roughly 30 minutes, one library is presented per session and the code will be made available afterwards. Come by, enjoy your lunch with us and step up your Python game!

## Registration

Registration for Lunch Time Python sessions is not required. You can still register using [this form](https://ssc.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/form/lunch-time-python-registration) to

* give us a better idea about the potential audience and what libraries we should present.
* make us send you a reminder the day before the session

Suggestions for libraries to present are very welcome as a [github issue](https://github.com/ssciwr/lunch-time-python/issues/new/choose) or as an [email to the SSC developers](mailto:ssc@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de)

## Licensing
