# Lunchtime #4: pytest (Feb. 25)

[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) is a widely used Python test framework,
which makes it easy to write small and readable tests,
and also offers more advanced features such as fixtures and mocks.
There is also a large ecosystem of plugins providing additional functionality.
